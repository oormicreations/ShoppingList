      <td><p>This minimalist shopping list app saves you the trouble of making a new list every time you visit the store.</p>
          <p>Just swipe an item to include/exclude it from the list. When excluded it fades out, and indicates that you don't need to buy it today. To include it again swipe it again.</p>
          <p>You can add more items by tapping on the big "+" button. To remove something or to add details, long press on an item. Single tap shows the details, which is not much - quantity, cost and any special notes.</p>
          <p>Every time you change something, the estimated cost is updated. This is a good reminder to carry enough cash with you.</p>
          <p>To keep it all simple and clean, there are no currency signs or units of measurements. You already know what they are. In case something goes wrong, reset the list from the menu.</p>
          <p>This app is open source and free. Please share :) </p></td>
